    "content": "Here are some tips and tricks to help out newer members prepare for various duties.\nInvocator\nTimer\nBallot Counter\nAhhh Counter\nWord Master\nGrammarian\nTable Topics Master\nEvaluator\nGeneral Evaluator\nToastmaster of the Day\n\nInvocator:\n\nYou are the designated member who will give some words of inspiration and will lead the group in the Pledge of Allegiance at the beginning of the meeting, as soon as the TM invites you to do so.\nThe type of invocations depends on if you are religious (and want us to know) or not. If the first applies, pick a short prayer or quotation that you feel would be appropriate for us. It doesn&#8217;t matter which religion.\nIf the second applies, then pick a quote (or very short story) from any source that you feel appropriate that would leave us feeling inspired. You can also connect the invocation with the theme of the day.\nKeep it to a maximum of 2 minutes, including the Pledge.\nYou will be one of the first people to address the group, so please arrive on time.\n\n \nTimer:\n\nYou will need to announce your duty at the beginning. As part of that, you need to include the following:\n\nTable Topics are two minutes.\nEvaluations are three minutes.\nSpeeches are normally seven minutes, but may be longer.\nWhen there is 2 minutes left, the green light comes on\nWhen there is 1 minute left, the yellow light comes on\nWhen their time is up, the red light comes on\nThere is a 30 second &#8220;grace&#8221; period after the red light comes on. After that, the red light will begin to flash (the computer may beep) and we will all applaud until you stop talking and sit down.\nNOTE: For ice breaker speeches only, the screen will blink, but there will be no beeping and we will not applaud or interrupt your speech.\nThere is no fine if you speak too long or not long enough.\nAt the end of the meeting, you will give your report\n\n\nNOTE: The above rules only apply to our club. Contests (and some other clubs) use a different set of rules. The computer timer can be adjusted to use those instead, if desired.\nAt the end of the meeting, you will need to give a report of the allocated and used time for each speaker, TT, and Evaluator (including the GE).\nFor speeches, if you have a range of minutes, use the high value to set the timer.\nDon&#8217;t start timing the General Evaluator until the other evaluators have done their evaluations\nStart the timer as soon as the person says a word &#8211; regardless of what it is or why they say it.\nTiming Options:\n\nIf using the computer based timer:\n\nPress Enter to start and ESC to stop (you can also click the buttons, but pressing the keys can be done even if you can&#8217;t see the screen)\nThere are options to choose the type of presentation. If you choose Evaluations or Table Topics, it will set the time for you and it can&#8217;t be changed.\nThe option for &#8220;Contest values&#8221; tells it to time the way a contest is timed, not the way we usually time TT and Evals.\nIf you choose speech or custom, you can enter the amount of time for the speech. The time is entered as numbers, not times. Since most presentations are measured in whole numbers, this is usually not a problem. But if you want 3 1/2 minutes, use 3.5 for the time.\nIf this is an icebreaker, click on the check box to not make any noise if they are over time (but you can still let if flash.)\nWhen you press ESC (or click on the Stop button) the amount of time used will show on the screen.\n\n\nIf using the manual timer.\n\nIn the event that a computer timer is unavailable, you can still time using a watch. You should have one that has a second hand. If you do not, ask to borrow one from a member.\nThere are three colored pieces of paper, shaped like circles &#8211; in Green, Yellow, and Red. At the appropriate time, hold up the circle with the appropriate color. Do not put it down until you are sure the speaker has seen the paper.\nIf the speaker goes overtime, start the applause\n\n\n\n \nBallot Counter:\n\nYour role is to collect and process the votes for best speaker, best evaluator and best table topic speaker. At the beginning of the meeting, the TM will ask you how you want the ballots.\nSome people like to wait until the very end of the meeting and then count up the votes for each category. Others prefer to get the votes after each section (TT, speeches, and evaluations). This second option provides with more time to count so there is less rush at the end of the meeting. It also prevents people from changing their vote based on the evaluator&#8217;s feedback. However, you can pick whatever seems more comfortable to you. Advise the group when the TM asks you. This will be a good time for you to drop the &#8220;Word of the day&#8221;. If there is a guest, it would be appropriate to describe your role briefly so he/she understands the way the club works.\nRemember that the General Evaluator is also eligible to be best evaluator, so you don&#8217;t want to collect ballots (or evaluator ballots) until the GE is done.\nWrite out the winners for each category and give it to the president who will present the awards to the whole group.\nGive to each speaker the slips with the feedback from the audience.\n\n \nAh Counter &#8211; You can count anything that is an unnecessary filler such as:\n\nYour job is to track those times when someone makes a noise to fill the blank space that happens while they try to think. Examples are:\n\nAhhh, Ummm,\nYou Know\nOK, so\nRepeated words (I I, You you, etc.)\nLike, basically (as in &#8220;I am, like, so into things.  Basically, I just love them all.&#8221; &#8211; both words are redundant.\n\n\nAt the beginning of the meeting, you will be asked to explain your duties.\n\nYou will track each ahhh, ummm, etc. for each person\nAt the end of the meeting, you will give a report\nThe fine will be 5 cents for each infraction.\nThere is a maximum fine of 50 cents (or 10 infractions.)\n\n\nIn your report at the end of the meeting:\n\nIdentify each person who spoke and the total number of infractions.\nTell them how much money they owe (remember, the maximum is 50 cents, even if they had 72 infractions.)\nYou may want to group them in a way similar to the list above.\n\n\n\n \nWord Master &#8211; This is an easy job if you plan well.\n\nHere are some tips for getting a word:\n\nYou can pick a word from the dictionary.\nRead the &#8220;Enrich your vocabulary&#8221; quiz in Readers Digest\nThe Word of the Day on Merriam-Webster\n\n\nWhen you have picked a word, use MS Word or some other editor to print it out. Use the following guidelines:\n\nUse Landscape so it prints &#8220;sideways&#8221; on the paper\nPrint the word in the largest font that will fit on the page\nInclude a definition of the word under the word &#8211; again use the largest font that you can (but usually less than the word itself) so that the members can read the definition from a distance.\nIf you can, print this on both sides &#8211; so you can read it while you are showing it to us.\nThere should be a paperclip attached to the front of the lectern on which you can attach the word. Before the meeting starts, try to make sure that the clip is there. If not, ask the Sergeant at Arms to find it for you. Otherwise, try to get some tape from the hotel front desk (Fletcher often has some in his computer case as well.)\n\n\nRemember that there is a twenty five cent find for anyone who speaks and does not use the word.\n\n \nGrammarian &#8211; This is an easy job. No fines and even better, no worries about right or wrong. If you catch an error, tell us about it. If it is you who are wrong instead, no big deal. Just try your best. You can always listen for some of these types of errors\n\nIncorrect use of a plural when singular should be used (adding an &#8220;s&#8221; to a word when you shouldn&#8217;t.\nMixing past and present tenses\nDangling participles. Remember that a participle is never a word to end a sentence with! (NOTE: The previous sentence is a good example of a dangling participle &#8211; use &#8220;with which to end a sentence&#8221; instead.\n\n \nTable Topics Master &#8211; Your job is to ask questions of the members. The idea is for them to practice answering questions with little or no preparation. The topic of the day is in the schedule. You can get a copy of the schedule by contacting the VP of Education &#8211; but you should be emailed one automatically. You can get ideas of questions to ask by doing research on Google or other search engine. But here are some good links for you as well:\n\n\nhttp://www.scopesys.com/today/\nhttp://www.historyorb.com/today/index.shtml\nhttp://dir.yahoo.com/Arts/Humanities/History/This_Day_in_History/\n\n\nA few key things to remember:\n\nCome prepared with at least 5 or 6 questions. It is better to have enough than to run out.\nAfter you have asked 3, look to the TM. They will give you a signal if they want you to stop. Otherwise, keep going.\nSome people will take very little time to answer. Others may take quite a bit of time and be clapped down. Leave it to the TM to manage the time since they know how much they have allocated for TT.\nWith 3 speakers and evaluators, you should have time for 3 questions. With fewer speakers, you will have more time for questions unless one of the speakers has a much longer speech time allocation. Check with the TM ahead of time to make sure you have enough questions.\nIf you run out of questions and can&#8217;t think of any, then re-ask one or more of your questions to a different person.\nAlways call on members who have NO duties first. Then those with &#8220;light&#8221; duties (anything other than SP, EV, GE, TM). If you feel you need to call on someone in that last group, start with the EV as the others may be busy getting ready for the next portion of the meeting.\n\nEvaluator:\n\nHere are some tips for you to remember while evaluating the speech:\n\nTry to avoid commenting on the subject matter. For example, he may do a speech on pro choice and you may be pro life. It is really easy to contribute your opinions on the topic. But that is not your job. Your job is to identify how well he delivered his topic &#8211; even if you totally disagreed with it\nThe speaker&#8217;s manual has two sections. The first is the information they used to create the speech. This is not required reading although I do try to read through it so I get a better idea of the guidelines he had to create the speech. The second (and more important part) is the evaluation section. This gives you an overview of what they are to accomplish by the speech and a series of questions or things for you to observe while they are speaking. You can mark in the book (that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s for) so they can have the comments down the road.\nHow relaxed was he? Was he tied to the lectern?\nEye contact &#8211; did he try to look people in the eye when he talked to them or did his eyes just &#8220;float&#8221; over the heads of the audience\nDid his voice change from it&#8217;s normal volume and tone when he needed to make a point?\n\nDid it get loud or soft?\nWhat about the pitch &#8211; did that change much?\n\n\nGestures &#8211; Did he &#8220;pray&#8221; &#8211; holding his hands in front of him as if he were praying. Or did he hold his hands in some other way that wasn&#8217;t conducive to his presentation. Generally, his hands should be at his side (not in his pocket) except when gesturing. When he does gesture, do they add to his presentation or is he &#8220;speaking&#8221; with his gestures rather than creating an effect?\nBody language? Did he smile or use other facial gestures to make a point or relax the audience? What other body language things did he do that affected how you felt about the presentation?\nDid he have a good opening? Did it get your attention?\nWas the content presented in such a way that it kept your attention?\nDid he have a conclusion that wrapped up what he said?\n\nDid it seem hurried?\nDid it leave you with a &#8220;satisfied&#8221; feeling?\n\n\nIf he didn&#8217;t use or look at his notes much &#8211; did the presentation seem to flow well? Did he jump around or seem to back track to get points he accidentally missed because he wasn&#8217;t using the notes?\nDid it appear as if he had rehearsed it and was familiar with the subject matter and how he was going to deliver it?\n\n\nHere are some tips for you to remember while preparing and presenting your evaluation:\n\nAs you go over the list, identify the things he did well and the things that he might have some room to improve. As you get ready to do your spoken evaluation, pick the top two &#8211; four of each and present those. After the meeting, you can give him your notes which may identify more than the ones you mention out loud &#8211; so don&#8217;t try to cram in so many points that you run out of time. You will have three minutes to do the evaluation &#8211; but you might be surprised by how fast the time can go.\nDon&#8217;t say &#8220;You should&#8221;, instead use phrases like &#8220;If I were doing this, I would&#8230;.&#8221; or &#8220;You might consider&#8221;. In other words, you don&#8217;t want to tell him what to do, just give him ideas of what you might do.\nTry to mimic things the speaker did wrong so that he can see why you felt that way. So if he was praying, you might stand there holding your hands the same way. But before then, make sure you have them at your side, then get them back there again (even if they don&#8217;t stay there &#8211; hands are horrible things &#8211; always trying to get in the way and jump all over the place&#8230;. 🙂 )\n\n\n\nGeneral Evaluator\nDuring the week, the General Evaluator is responsible for the following:\n\nProviding an introduction to the TM\nContacting the Toastmaster of the Day early in the week.\nContacting all the Evaluators for the meeting and assigning them to a given speaker. Of course, until you know who will be speaking, this can be hard to do, hence the previous item.\nGet a small amount of information to use for a brief introduction of each evaluator.\nPaying attention to how well the TM communicates and prepares during the week.\n\nDuring the meeting:\n\nYour first and highest priority is to provide feedback to the evaluators (how can they improve otherwise?) One approach is to evaluate each speaker as if you were evaluating them. Then compare your notes to what was said by the evaluator. But also look for other things including:\n\nHow well did they explain the pros and cons of the presentation?\nDid they evaluate the speech or the content (we are learning to speak better, how well did they do in presenting their topic, regardless of what it may have been. For example, if the speech was on gay marriage, did the evaluator waste time giving an &#8220;opposing&#8221; view instead of focusing on how the speech was delivered? The most common exception to this rule might be if it were a speech &#8220;to persuade&#8221; in which case, the evaluator could indicate if they were persuaded or not.\nWhere possible, did they demonstrate the pro or con as they explained it?\nDid they have a roughly equal number of pros and cons?\nWas the evaluation appropriate for the speaker&#8217;s skill level?\nWas the constructive feedback given in a positive way?\nFor opinion issues, did the evaluator use terms like &#8220;I felt that &#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I prefer to &#8230;&#8221;, etc.?\nDid they finish on time?\n\n\nOnce you have evaluated the evaluators, use the remaining time to evaluate the TM and meeting overall. This might include:\n\nWas the organization during the week handled well or did the TM wait until the last minute?\nWas the TM well prepared for the meeting?\nWere unexpected issues handled well?\nDid the meeting flow smoothly?\nIf guests were there, were they properly introduced?\nWere the duties clearly explained?\nWas the TT Master prepared for as many questions as the TM needed to fill the time? Were they appropriate for the topic?\nWere all the speakers (SP, GE, and TT) properly introduced? If not, was it the TM&#8217;s fault or did the member not provide adequate information to use for an introduction? If the latter, how well did the TM handle it?\n\n\n\nToastmaster of the Day\n\nOK, you have done all the other duties and are now ready for this one. Think back on your experiences with the other duties. How did the various TMs interact with you? What seemed to help you and what did not? What could the TM have done to make your task easier, more fun, less frustrating, etc.? Then think about how you could address those issues when you are TM.\nThe easiest way to plan the meeting is to use the spreadsheet used by the VPE to schedule duties &#8211; it has a special meeting planning section that helps confirm members and generate an agenda for you.  Contact the VPE for more details.\nReview the schedule to see who has what duties. Then send an E-mail to the list identifying all the people who have duties (and what they are). Again, think back to similar E-mails you have received. Send this to the main list so that people know you are on top of the tasks.\nHopefully, when people reply, they will reply to you (not the list) since the other members don&#8217;t need to know if a given member will or will not do their duty.\nWhile you might list the evaluators in your initial E-mail, it is the GEs responsibility to contact the evaluators and assign them to speakers, not yours. Why make more work for yourself than you need.\nSpeaking of the GE, they can be a big help in getting ready for the meeting.\nIf someone lets you know that they cannot perform a given task, ask them (nicely of course) to please try to find a replacement and then let you know who they found. You will have enough on your hands so that it is easier to have the member find the replacement.\nIdentify one TM member who is very experienced and can fill in for any role. Contact them to confirm they will be at the meeting and ask them if they can be your &#8220;emergency&#8221; backup. If a member oversleeps or just doesn&#8217;t show up, you can fall back on this person to bail you out without having to run around last minute.\nFor each speaker, the TT, and the GE, request information that you can use to introduce them. Ask them how they feel about the topic of the day, how long have they been in Toastmasters, or any other information that you can use in their introduction.\nEither use the spreadsheet the VPE uses to schedule the meetings or get a template of the meeting schedule from the Yahoo Groups site (in the files section) and use that to figure out who you will call and in what order. Some people like to identify the Ahh counter and Word Master first so that they can start listening for infractions immediately. And then call on them last at the end of the meetings when people are giving their report. This way, they can get the most revenue for the club\nRemember to call the joke master after the last duty report. You can identify the joke master when you are asking people to explain their duties, but they usually won&#8217;t say anything until the end. You do have the option to call them BEFORE the ahh counter though&#8230;.\nIf you have to double up any duties, DO NOT give the ballot counter an additional duty that requires a report at the end of the meeting (they need that time to tally ballots, etc.)\nWhen the meeting starts, be aware of any guests. If we have guests, make sure that the duties and purposes of each part of the meeting are clearly explained so the guest understands the various ways they can benefit.\nContact the TT master in advance and make sure they have AT LEAST 5 questions. You control the time of the meeting. If you have two 5-7 minute speeches, you have time for at least 5 TT questions (or more if some people speak for a very short time.) Please provide the TT master with the following lists:\n\nAll the members with no duties at all (so they will have at least one chance to speak during the meeting)\nAll members (and the duty) who have &#8220;light duties (ahh counter, ballot counter, etc.) so they can be called on if there are few or no members without a duty.\nRemind the TT that they should not be calling on members who are performing any of the following jobs: GE, TM, SP, or E. These people should only be called if all the other members have been called first &#8211; and then, start with the Evaluators first.\nRemind the TT not to call on any guests (unless they are current TM members in another club or former members of our club.)\nAfter the third question, expect the TT Master to look at you for a signal. Should they keep going or not? Look at your schedule. If they ask another question, will it result in the meeting going late? If not, go for it. Remember that we used to have 3 speakers (and evaluators) per meeting, so you should have time unless a speaker is giving a long speech.\nNOTE: The spreadsheet the VPE has will generate a list of minor/no duty members for you.\n\n\nTry to contact your speakers early in the week to give them time to prepare. Ask them which manual they will be using to create their speech (we want to encourage members to speak from the manuals.)\nIntroductions:\n\nYour GE can be introduced with a standard introduction. (Remember that they will then introduce each evaluator.)\nEach speaker should be introduced with the introduction you received from them (hopefully in advance.) You should then also specify the following:\n\nSpeech title\nManual used\nPurpose of the speech\nTime range\nNOTE: if a non manual speech, there should still be a title, purpose, and time range.\n\n\nDon&#8217;t forget to send your introduction to the President to be used to introduce you!\n\n\nRemember that the Sgt. at arms will start the meeting and call up the President of the club. That person will then call on the invocator. Following that, they will introduce you. Make sure you have sent them information for them to use for your introduction.\nIf you have to call on any members to fill in at the last minute, remember to update the member lists you give to the TT master.\nIf you are in a position of having to find a replacement because some member did not have any consideration for you, consider the following:\n\nUse newer members to fill in for light duties (provided they have done it at least once before.)\nUse seasoned members to fill in for more involved duties. You have a number of members who can perform SP, E, GE, and/or TT duties with little or no preparation. Don&#8217;t &#8220;waste&#8221; them by giving them a &#8220;light&#8221; duty until you are sure your major duties are filled.\n\n\nWhen you are done, you will return control of the meeting to the President who will announce the winners, bring up any club business, review next week&#8217;s duties, etc. Your job is done after you call up the joke master.\n\nFeel free to submit any additional Tips and Tricks of your own. Just send them to the Webmaster.&lt;/li&gt;\nThe agenda template is available NVTM agenda template\n\n",

    "content": "This is essentially a meeting that is best for those times when there may be few members – usually times around major holidays.  For example, if July 4th occures on a day other than Friday, it is often that many people may take the Friday closest to the holiday off and can’t come to the meeting.\n\nRather than cancel the meeting, we often have Grab Bag meetings – one where all the roles (from TM down) are put in a bag and as people arrive, they pick their role from the bag.  Once everyone has arrived, if there are still duties in the bag, then members pick again until all the duties are assigned.\n\nSome things to consider if you will be putting on such a meeting:\n\n\n  Sometimes, it’s good to at least assign a TM so there is a more experienced member “herding all the cats”…\n  In some cases, it might be good to put the more difficult duties in a separate bag – TM, GE, SP, TT as they do require a little more preparation and experience to be able to do with little to no notice.  Then the less experienced members can choose to pick from either bag.\n  There are manuals that have speeches that involved impromptu presentations.  So again, it might be good to remind advanced speakers to see if they have such a speech and can get credit for it.\n  Remember that, like any other meeting, you can get credit towards your leadership manual requirements for performing a given duty.\n\n\nThe key thing to remember is that you are here to have fun.  So if you end up with a duty that you think is too hard, just have fun with it.\n\n",

So find ways to work where you get maximum benefit.  Practicing a speech over the phone with your mentor may be much more effective than trying to set up a time to meet in person – unless you work/live near each other.\n      Ask your mentor to meet with you after any meeting where you give a speech and ask them for additional feedback.\n      Go over any of the written feedback with your mentor when you feel you need a better understanding of what was written or why it might be important.\n      Have your speeches taped.

    "content": "Congratulations on joining NVTM!\n\nIn addition to the manuals you received, we have tried to provide you with a fair amount of information to make your membership in our club a rewarding and fun experience.\n\nHere you can find tips in the following categories:\n\n\n  General Tips\n  Table Topics\n  Your First Speech (Ice Breaker)\n\n\nGeneral Tips\n\n\n  Review the Duty Roles Page BEFORE you have a duty. You may want to print that page out and bring it with you in case you are assigned a duty at a club meeting to cover an unexpected absence.\n  Remember that as a duty master, you will have to explain your role.  This is your first opportunity to practice speaking.  Take the time to make sure you understand what you should say when you explain your role.\n  Determine how often you want to speak (as well as perform other duties) and contact the VP of Education. They are responsible for scheduling you in your various tasks.\n  If you want to speak and are not yet on the schedule (or not scheduled to speak) get a copy of the schedule (from the VP of Education). Each week, contact the TM for that week’s meeting and tell them that you would be happy to speak (or perform another duty) if they need someone.\nBe prepared for Table Topics as you will most likely be called on in your first or second meeting as a new member.\n\n\nTable Topics\n\n  \n    From the day your membership is completed, it is very likely that you will be called. In fact, it is likely that you will speak responding to a Table Topics This is one of your best tools in Toastmasters. Is there a possibility that, at some point in your life, you will be at a meeting and will be asked to say something about what you do, with little to no time to prepare? How well will you do? Table topics helps you prepare for those moments when you only have 1-2 minutes to speak, yet you need to come across in a positive manner.\n  \n  \n    Table Topics – Tips for answering questions\n    \n      If you are asked a question during table topics and don’t know the answer, don’t say that. Simply change the subject without admitting anything and tell us what you do know. So if the question is: “Please describe why you feel that a Barbie Doll is better than a GiGi doll” and you don’t even know a “GiGi doll” from a rock, you might answer using one of the following approaches (note the …. means you fill in from there):\n        \n          “Well, I find that dolls seem to serve a unique need with young girls. But there are lots of other things that can meet this same need. And yet, people tend to give girls dolls and boys guns. I think that……”\n          “Well, I never had either type of doll growing up (hey, as a boy, I wanted the GI Joe Super Bazooka!) But with two small boys of my own, I have found that it does help to know a little about toys and how they compare. Why just the other day, I was in the toy store and ……”\n          “Well, I never had a “GiGi Doll” but I did have a Barbie. One time, I remember playing with her and …….\n        \n      \n      Note in the previous examples that, while you mentioned the key items of the question, you were able to turn the question into a topic that you might find more interesting (and about which you may have some ideas.) If you do this, try to bring the initial question back in at the end. So the first sample answer above, you might conclude with something like “As a guy, I still don’t understand why girls like dolls, but now that I am a father, I am sure that my daughter can spend hours telling me the difference between GiGi and Barbie.”\n      One great way to practice this on your own can be found at the folllowing link: http://www.thinkfu.com/toyfu/tt/index.html – This is a site that gives you a topic type question and a timeing light so you can practice entirely on your own (thanks Emilia!)\n    \n  \n\n\nYour first speech (your Ice Breaker)\n\n  Your first speech (also known as your Ice Breaker) will be from the manual that should arrive shortly after you joined the club. It is sent from the Toastmasters Headquarters. Alternatively, you may receive a manual from the club. If you do, please return the manual you receive in the mail to the club.\n  Request a mentor (see the Mentors Page). They should be happy to help you with tips and ideas.\n  Try to have an opening and close that fit together and are well memorized. For example, you might start with something like:\n  “I am not what I appear to be”\n  and then end with :\n  “I so, now that you all know me better, you might also agree that I am not what\n  I appear to be”\n  See how the opening statement (and maybe the title) match the closing statement. Your mentor might be able to help you with this.\n  Remember, we are your friends. Relax and just tell us about yourself.\n  The purpose of this speech is for you to tell us about you. Since you have been you all your life, you know more about you than anyone else. This may sound silly, but, if you think about it, it makes sense for you to start with a topic that you know well.\n  While the manual will explain much of what you need to know, try to include:\n    \n      Where you were born\n      A little about your parents and siblings\n      Your life growning up\n      Where you went to college\n      What type of work do you do\n      Your present status (job, family, kids, etc.)\n      Hobbies (current and past)\n    \n  \n  If you think about some of these things, you will probably find it difficult to keep your speech within the 4-6 mintute timeframe.\n  If you feel you need notes, remember that you know the details. So only include key words in an outline format. So you might have:\n    \n      Born\n      Parents worked at\n      I went to school\n      I graduated and\n      I met my husband (wife) at\n      etc.\n    \n  \n  Don’t have more in your notes than you need. If you look at the list above, you know what else is needed, all you might need is a reminder of what order you may want to tell us these things.\n  If you do use notes, make sure you have the key points printed in a large enough font that you can read them easily from a distance. Then put the notes on the lecturn and just refer to them when you need them.\n\n",

    "title": "Presentation Tips",
    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "Here are some tips and tricks to help out new and seasoned members as they prepare for various speeches.\n\n\n  Using a Computer and Projector\n  Using Power Point to enhance your presentation properly\n  Props\n  Preparing for a speech\n  Improving your pronounciation\n  Using Video/Audio recordings to improve your delivery\n  Things you might do to prepare the room/audience for your speech\n  Things you should NOT do or be very carefull when you do.\n  Involving other members in your presentation\n\n\nUsing a Computer and Projector:\n\nIf you plan to use you computer and projector for your presentation, please consider the following:\n\n\n  Copy the presentation (NOT a shortcut) to a USB/thumb drive in case anything happens and your can’t get your computer to work as desired.\n  Notify the TM early (I MEAN EARLY) in the week and ask them to request that the projector be brought to the meeting. Usually, the Sgt at Arms has it.\n  Bring along a power cord. There is nothing worse than running out of battery power and not having a power cord.\n  Plan to arrive very early and test your computer with the projector. Get everything working the way you want and then tell the computer to hibernate or go into sleep mode. This way, someone else can also use the projector. Ask the TM to turn on the projector (and maybe wake your computer) before you are introduced so that they are ready to go when you are.\n  If you do not have a computer, check with the TM to see if you can use the computer that is usually used for timeing. If you do this, then the timer of the day will need to use a different computer. But you need to make sure that everything has been worked out early enough. Do NOT wait until Thur. night to plan things.\n  LEARN about your computer. There are certain funtion keys that will turn on/off video to an external monitor.\n  Make sure you have current drivers and software for your computers video card. This can make it even easier to set up for an external monitor/projector.\n  Remember that you may be in a position in the future where you will be expected to make a presentation. Learn all you can at our meetings so that you are prepared to present in a location without the support you have at NVTM.\n\n\nUsing Power Point to enhance your presentation properly:\n\n\n  KISS – Keep it (all slides) Simple Silly (or whatever you want that starts with “S”)\n  Slides should either contain\n    \n      a graphic (with little or no text)\n      5 or few lines of text\n    \n  \n  Don’t spend time with transitions unless you are really good at it. You want your slides to compliment your presentation, not become a distraction.\n  NEVER read your slides. Your slides should be a visual outline of your presentation, NOT the presentation. Another way is to consider the slides to be your outline.\n  Avoid using fonts too small to read,\n  Use a master template so that all slides are uniform with a background that does not distract or make it hard to read the text.\n  You can always print out your slides in advance and hand them out after your presentation. The only reason to hand them out before your presentation is if you expect people to take notes. Otherwise, they will read ahead and might miss some of your important content.\n  Determine how you will change the slides. A wireless, remote mouse will do it. There are also some things you can buy that are designed to work with a computer and power point. Or you might even have someone click the mouse for you, but make sure you have an easy way for them to know when to click.\n  A laser pointer is a good way to point to something, but so is the mouse. And a laser pointer is illegal in Canada and some other places – so don’t depend on it.\n  Always have a backup of your slides on a USB Thumb drive. Make sure you COPY the presentation to the thumb drive (rather than a shortcut to the presentation.)\n  Remember that 10% or so of the population is color blind. Trying viewing your slides in black and white and see how easy they are to read.\n  Don’t use animations unless they really do add to your presentation.\n  Stand to one side of the screen (I tend to be on the right side so that they read the text and end up looking at me. There are different schools of thought on which side is better.\n\n\nProps:\n\nThere are presntation that go better if you have a prop. But don’t let the props detract from your presentation.\n\n\n  Have the TM set up any props as necessary before you are introduced. Or set them up yourself and then put them aside. Have the TM put them out before your introduction.\n  If you will have any audience participation with your props, assume that the audience will take too long, not do it right, etc. In most cases, you want to avoid this.\n  Don’t use something very valuable as a prop if you can help it.\n  Be prepared for something to go wrong with the prop (left at home, fell out while you were driving to the meeting, someone sat on it before you spoke, etc.)\n  Make sure that everyeen can see it clearly.\n  Avoid props that need to be handed from person to person – it takes focus away from you.\n  Fletchers Props law – if it can leak, it will. If it moves, it won’t. If it doesn’t break, it will during the presentation.\n\n\nPreparing for a speech:\n\n\n  Prepare an outline – what do you want to say, what are the key points you want to make and how do you want to conclude it.\n  You should strive for a main topic, three supporting facts, and the conclusion.\n  Determine the goal of your conclusion – is it just a wrap up, a call to action, what?\n  Practice it so that you can present it in the time available.\n  Have at least one point/concept/fact you can use or not, as time permits.\n  Memorize your opening and conclusion\n  If you need notes, just use an outline. You can’t just read your notes, so you might as well only have what you need to jog your memory. Print out your outlinein 14 (or larger) point font. Place that on the lecturn. Slide the sheets behind the others as you complete each topic (if you find you have more than one – which should be rare.)\n\n\nImproving your pronounciation:\n\nIf you want to improve your pronounciation, you have a number of choices. But your best starting point is to record your presentation and then listen to it later. How well do you understand what you said. Then get together with a native speaker and ask them for comments. I have found that there are often key sounds that can be a struggle for people and learning to master those sounds will solve many of the problems they have being understood.\n\nUsing Video/Audio recordings to improve your delivery:\n\nYou will find it to be a great advantage to have your speech taped so you can review it later – on your own or with your mentor.  To have it taped, you will need to bring a standard SD memory card.  The club had a group purchase of these and you can purchase one for about $10 or so.  Check with the EVP for information on getting one.  If your computer does not have a way to read SD cards, then we also have some SD cards that come with readers you can plug into your USB port.\n\nThings you might do to prepare the room/audience for your speech:\n\n\n  Have the TM set up any props you may want to use\n  Have the TM “set the stage” for the audience. For example, if this is a sales pitch, then the audience should know who the target audience would be.  Or if this is a business presentation, the TM should explain to the members what type of employees (vendors?) they are and the role that the speaker (you) have in relation to them.\n\n\nInvolving other members in your presentation:\n\n\n  Don’t forget to look at the audience and include them whenever possible.\n  If you are saying something that some might disbelieve, say it in a way that won’t have them discounting your speech. For example, if you hear “Everyone knows that the moon is green” or “It’s a fact that the moon is green” – you know it isn’t. Even if you don’t know for sure, you are at least very apprehensive about the fact. Suppose instead you heard “I believe the moon is green. While it may not appear that way to you, let me tell you why and maybe you too will see the moon in a new light.” Both say the same thing, but the second at least presents it in a way that will encourage the audience to listen rather than just tune you out.\n  Never tell the audience that they are stupid, no matter how stupid they are.\n  Smile\n\n\nThings you should NOT do or be very carefull when you do.\n\n\n  Do not leave the lecturn until someone comes to replace you (and shake your hand.)\nDon’t thank us for the pleasure we recieved hearing you talk to us. The exception might be if your conclusion is a call to action and you are thanking us in advance for the action we might do.\n  Do not use vulgarity, make recially overtoned jokes or comments, insult members of the audience.\n  You are encouraged to take controversal views on any subject (politics, abortion, religion, etc.) but do so in a way that does not insult those members who feel contrary to you.  If you do decide to give such a presentation, you are encouraged to wait until you have given at least 6-8 speeches first, so you understand enough techniques to deal with the subject.  There is even an advanced speech that involves giving a speech on a controversal topic.\n\n\nFeel free to submit any additional Tips and Tricks of your own. Just send them to the Webmaster.\n",

    "content": "On occasions, we have social events.  Most commonly, these are the Christmas party and the Summer Party.\n\nIf you feel that it is approprate to have an event of some sort, feel free to suggest it during the business portion of a meeting.\n\nOnce it has been decided that we want to have an event, a chairperson is appointed.\n\nIf you are the chairperson, here are some tips for you:\n\n\n  Always select the location first.  Suggested locations include a members house, a condo/home owners common event area, a park, or similar venues.  However, if you have an idea for something special, go for it.  But we rarely pay money for event locations.\n  Pick a few dates that are open for the desired location and present them to the club to see which date can get the most attendees.\n  Regarding food, etc. the club usually provides plasticware and a main dish (ham, turkey, whatever) and then we have everyone else bring something – essentially a pot luck.\n  As chairperson, your job will be MUCH easier if you get some fellow members to help you out.\n  We do have a special Yahoo events email list you can use to plan the event.  Talk to the VP of Technology to get it set up for you.\n\n\nOnce you have put on your successfull event, remember to come back to this page to see if you have some additional ideas that should be added to make it even easier for the next person.\n",

    "title": "Table Topics Grab Bag",
    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "On occasions, the theme of the day will be &#8220;Grab Bag&#8221;.  In this case, the TT has the option to choose whatever they would like for TT.  The idea is to have a special form of TT where the questions are not based on a specific theme but on a style of presenting questions.\nTo make this easy for you, we have compiled a list of possible choices the TT may use should they be TT for a meeting with a Grab Bag Theme.\nNOTE: A grab bag TT theme is NOT the same as a Grab Bag Meeting (which is where all the roles are selected by picking the role from a hat/bag).\nIf you are TT for a meeting with a grab bag theme, read through the list of ideas below and pick one as the basis for your TT questions.\n\nAsk each TT speaker to describe his/her life as if he/she were an object, i.e., a mirror, a table, a chair, a briefcase, a door, etc.\nAsk a member to give an elevator pitch for their company as if they were the founder.\nAsk a member to explain why they would be the ideal person to:\n\n\nBe the next Mayor, Senator, etc.\nBe the Chief of police, fire, etc.\nBe awarded a Nobel Prize\nPerform/present at some major event\n\n\nAsk the speaker to talk about the bumper sticker, real or imagined, on their car. They can include &#8220;Sky diving &#8211; A Natural High&#8221; and &#8220;Protected by Smith &amp; Wesson&#8221; etc.\nBring in a bag of coins and have each speaker talk about something that happened or something they were doing in the year that is stamped on the coin.\nCollect some products off the grocery shelf, your junk box, a hardware store, etc.  and put them in a big bag.  Ask a member to pick one from the bag (without looking) and:\n\n\nDescribe what it is and how they would use it\nGive a sales pitch to make us want to buy it\nExplain how the item had an impact on their life\nWithout taking the object out of the bag, have them guess as to what it is and what we would do with it, just by touch.\nWithout showing it to us, describe it without telling us what it is.\nThe year is 2525 and the speaker is an archaeologist. They will explain their opinion as to what the item was back in the 20th. Century and how it was used.\n\n\nCut pictures (no captions) from the newspaper or magazine. Have the speaker pick one and tell the club what is happening in the picture.\nEveryone writes down a secret about themselves that no one in the club knows about. Each speaker takes one of the notes, reads it, and states who they think wrote the note and why.\nGive each speaker a &#8220;Dear Abby&#8221; question and have them give their advice. These could made-up by the Table Topics Master or real ones clipped from the advice columns.\nGive each speaker a sheet of paper with weird pictures drawn by a child (or you) and have the speaker be an art critic discussing the significance (or lack thereof) of the work.\nGive the speaker a quotation to interpret.  Variation: There&#8217;s a saying that the difference between involvement and commitment is like that of a chicken or a pig to breakfast. The chicken is involved, and the pig is committed. When it comes to life, which are you, a chicken or a pig?\nGive the speaker a strange and unheard word from the dictionary and ask them tell everyone what they think this word means. At the end, give the real definition.\nGive the speaker a title to a book that they have just authored and are promoting and ask them to explain to the members why we should all rush out and buy wonderful book.\nHand out small plastic containers with cotton wool soaked in a scent &#8211; dettol, perfume, etc. and asked the speaker what memories the scent evoked.\nHave a series of acronyms MMP, IRD, NBC, NASA etc. Ask for new meanings.\nHave each speaker discuss a time (real or imagined, but preferably real) when they saw or met a celebrity.\nHave each speaker pick from a bowl full of Chinese fortune cookies and have them read their fortune and interpret it to means to them. Note: Make sure everyone gets a cookie whether they speak or not.\nIf there are people in your club born in different areas (and/or different countries), try this: &#8220;What do people think they know about your birthplace that isn&#8217;t true?&#8221;\nIf you could be any age again for one week, what age would you be and why?\nIf you could fly in a hot-air balloon over any city in the world, what city would you choose and why?\nIf you could go back in time:\n\n\nAnd talk to yourself at the age of ten, what advice would you give yourself?\nAnd meet anyone in your family&#8217;s history, whom would you most want to meet?\nAnd talk with anyone for an hour, who would you choose and why?\n\n\nIf you were to jump into the future 40 years from now, what would be the most unexpected/unusual thing you will find?\nIf you had to wear a button with a maximum of five words what would it be and why?\nJeopardy! Come up with six question categories and then make five questions for each category. Take a poster board and make pockets for each question. Label the categories at the top of each column and have the speaker select from a category. You get the idea.\nMake personalized license plates, hand one to a person and ask &#8220;What type of vehicle are you and who owns you?&#8221; Some examples: ‘ICU4DK’ ‘SLO4X4’ ‘RWIDO’ ‘MYCAR’ ‘TRAVLN’\nRead a paragraph or short letter from letters to the editor of your local paper and have the members respond with their opinions.\nSome people say a little white lie is sometimes okay. What do you think?\nSometimes making change is like teaching a pig how to sing, it only frustrates you and annoys the pig. When was the last time you &#8220;tried to teach a pig how to sing?&#8221;\nSometimes when you look at a big task, it&#8217;s important to approach it just as if you were eating an elephant; one bite at a time. Which end would you start at and why?\nTake the first line from a song and have the speaker explain what inspired them to begin the song with that phrase.\nThink of 4 or 5 unusual situations that would normally be considered bad news. Challenge your speakers to make them good news instead. Some ideas:\n\n\nYou’re the mayor of a city. Godzilla just trashed the downtown area. Explain why that&#8217;s good for the city.\nAliens just vaporized the some monument. You&#8217;re the President. Make the first speech afterwards about why this is good news.\nYou just put your car through the garage door. Tell your spouse or significant other why this is good news.\n\n\nWhat annually televised sporting event is an absolute must-see for you?\nWhat national attraction or tourist site should every American see at least once?\nWrite down different &#8220;accomplishments&#8221; (best underwater basket weaver, best nuclear power plant designer, best TV remote control switcher, etc.) on pieces of paper.  The first speaker selects the award and must &#8220;award&#8221; it to another member, explaining why the recipient deserved it. The recipient then must get up and &#8220;accept&#8221; the award with a speech.\nWrite words on small pieces of paper or index cards. Have each speaker pick four pieces of paper or cards and make up a story using all 4 words. (You can also require using the &#8220;word of the day&#8221;.) Variations of the word are ok (If the word is &#8220;microscope&#8221;, then &#8220;microscopic&#8221; may be used in the story).\nOn small slips of paper write out some unusual or very descriptive colors (day-glow orange, pea green, flamingo pink etc.), make a list of questions along the lines of:\n\n\nExplain why all your clothes this summer will be in this color\nTell the person to your right why he/she should buy a car in this color.\nTell us why you plan to paint your house this color\n\n\nHave the speaker discuss a weird place to live and defend the place as a nice place to live, such as:\n\n\nNext to a nuclear power plant.\nIn a swamp.\nBottom of the Grand Canyon.\nTop of Mt Hamilton.\n\n\nEach person would be given one line and would have to weave a story from it. Here are a dozen different story lines to use: &#8220;The Impromptu Murders&#8221;\n\n\nIt was a dark and stormy night as lightning flashed through the window pane&#8230;..\nWhen the guests heard the noise, they stumbled down the hallway only to discover&#8230;.\nThe police arrived and asked everyone to&#8230;.\nFearing for my own safety I told the Police, &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t have done it because I&#8230;..&#8221;\nSeeing that now was the right time, the butler stepped forward and declared&#8230;..\nOld Mrs. Marple didn&#8217;t think anyone knew about her relationship with the deceased. I then stood up and told the group&#8230;..\nGasping for breath and holding her throat, the maid stumbled into the drawing room&#8230;.\nIt was then that the front door burst open and who should step in but&#8230;.\n&#8220;No!&#8221;, I cried. &#8220;It was I who did it, for you see the dead man was my&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;\nSurprising everyone, the dead man picked himself up off of the floor, looked around at the gathering and said&#8230;..\nJust when all had felt the mystery solved, the light went out&#8230;..\nThe policeman then stepped forward and announced to the guests, with a big smile on his face&#8230;.\n\n",

    "title": "Who We are ?",
    "excerpt": "\n",
    "content": "Some people are interested in who makes up the members of our club.\n\nThe focus of North Valley Toastmasters is the same as most clubs – simply to improve your speaking ability. While all general purpose clubs follow the same basic approach, there are very distinct differences between them. In our case, we tend to be a very upbeat, relaxed group. You will find a positive, supportive, and jovial atmosphere.\n\nWe currently have about 22-24 members with an average attendance of about 12-16. One of the members helped found the group back in 1965. Others are very new to the club.\n\nWe span the gamut of profiles: very young to very wise, high level executive to low wage earners to unemployed, self employeed and “other”.\n\nA number of our members have English as a second (or third, fourth, etc.) language. We are quite varied in so many ways that it really makes the meetings quite interesting.\n\nIn terms of our more experienced speakers, we have ex-mayors, ex-District Governors, people who have made presentations on live TV, in front of groups of 2000 plus, stage performers and more. Some of these members have been in the club for well over 10 years. So you will find lots of support on a variety of levels.\n\nOn the other hand, we also have a number of very new members who are just getting their feet wet (so to speak.)
