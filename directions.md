We meet at:

Dennys Restaurant ,333 S. Abbott, Milpitas,CA95035

Phone: (408) 262-9090

Its located just off Calaveras, between 680 and 880 (although it is much closer to 880).

If you are coming from 680, turn left on N. Abbott Ave (ok, you will be turning on to S. Abbott Ave but it is named N. Abbott on the side you are on before you turn.)

If you are coming from 880, turn right onto S. Abbott Ave.

In either case, the road goes for a short distance then makes a right hand turn.  The restaurant is on your right.
